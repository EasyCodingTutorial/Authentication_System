# Authentication System Using NEXT_AUTH

In this tutorial, we‚Äôll create a secure authentication system using **NextAuth.js** and **MongoDB** for data persistence. This guide is ideal for developers looking to implement route protection, credential-based login, and data management using modern web technologies without social authentication providers.

## Technologies Used
 - **Next.js**: A React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation, improving performance and SEO.
 - **NextAuth.js**: A flexible authentication solution for Next.js applications, allowing us to secure routes and handle session management.
 - **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database for storing user information securely.

## üìå In This Video:

- Setting up **NextAuth.js** with custom credentials
- Implementing route protection to restrict unauthorized access
- Storing and managing user data in **MongoDB**
- Following best practices for secure and scalable authentication

## Note: This project is for educational purposes only. Ensure to adhere to security best practices when implementing authentication in production.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to get the project running locally:

1. **Clone** the repository to your local machine.
2. **Navigate** to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies by running `npm install` or `yarn install`.
4. Set up your **MongoDB** connection string in an `.env` file.
5. Start the development server using `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.
6. Access the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
